    "## Question 1\n",
    "**What are Type I and Type II errors in hypothesis testing, and how do they impact decision-making?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer (concise):**\n",
    "- **Type I error (False Positive):** Rejecting the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) when it is actually true. Probability of Type I error is \\(\\alpha\\) (significance level).\n",
    "- **Type II error (False Negative):** Failing to reject \\(H_0\\) when the alternative hypothesis \\(H_a\\) is true. Probability of Type II error is \\(\\beta\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact on decision-making:**\n",
    "- Choosing a smaller \\(\\alpha\\) reduces the chance of Type I error but typically increases \\(\\beta\\) (more Type II errors) unless sample size is increased.\n",
    "- The trade-off matters: in medical testing, a Type I error may mean incorrectly declaring a treatment effective; a Type II error may miss a real beneficial effect. Choose \\(\\alpha\\) and sample size according to the context and consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip for exams:** define both errors, write the symbols (\\(\\alpha,\\beta\\)), and give a short practical example.\n"

    "## Question 2\n",
    "**What is the P-value in hypothesis testing, and how should it be interpreted in the context of the null hypothesis?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer (concise):**\n",
    "- **P-value** is the probability of observing test-statistic results at least as extreme as the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is true.\n",
    "- **Interpretation:** A small p-value (typically < \\(\\alpha\\)) indicates that the observed data are unlikely under \\(H_0\\), which provides evidence against \\(H_0\\) and may lead us to reject it. A large p-value means the data are consistent with \\(H_0\\) and we do not reject \\(H_0\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** P-value is _not_ the probability that \\(H_0\\) is true, nor the probability that the result occurred by chance alone. Always report the p-value and the chosen \\(\\alpha\\) when making conclusions.\n"

    "**Explain the difference between a Z-test and a T-test, including when to use each.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer (concise):**\n",
    "- **Z-test:** used when the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) is known and the sample size is large (commonly \\(n\\geq30\\)). The test statistic follows the standard normal distribution.\n",
    "- **T-test:** used when \\(\\sigma\\) is unknown and must be estimated from the sample (use sample standard deviation \\(s\\)). The test statistic follows Student's t-distribution with \\(n-1\\) degrees of freedom; for small samples the t-distribution accounts for extra uncertainty.\n",

    "## Question 4\n",
    "**What is a confidence interval, and how does the margin of error influence its width and interpretation?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer (concise):**\n",
    "- A **confidence interval (CI)** for a parameter (e.g., population mean) is a range constructed from sample data that, under repeated sampling, contains the true parameter a specified proportion of the time (confidence level, e.g., 95%).\n",
    "- **Margin of error (ME)** is half the width of the CI. For a mean: \\(\\text{ME} = z_{\\alpha/2} \\cdot \\dfrac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) (or use t critical value when appropriate).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Influence:** Larger ME -> wider interval -> less precision. ME decreases with larger sample size \\(n\\) and smaller variability \\(s\\), and depends on chosen confidence level (higher level -> larger critical value -> larger ME).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation tip:** A 95% CI does not mean there is a 95% probability the true parameter lies in the specific interval; it means the method produces intervals containing the true parameter in 95% of repeated samples.\n"

    "**Describe the purpose and assumptions of an ANOVA test. How does it extend hypothesis testing to more than two groups?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer (concise):**\n",
    "- **Purpose:** ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) tests whether three or more group means are equal by comparing between-group variability to within-group variability.\n",
    "- **Assumptions:** independence of observations, normally distributed residuals within each group, and equal variances (homoscedasticity) across groups.\n",
    "- **Extension:** Instead of multiple pairwise t-tests (which increase Type I error), ANOVA tests a single null hypothesis:\n",
    "  \\(H_0:\\ \\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\dots = \\mu_k\\) against the alternative that at least one mean differs. If ANOVA is significant, follow-up pairwise tests or post-hoc procedures (e.g., Tukey) identify which groups differ.\n"
