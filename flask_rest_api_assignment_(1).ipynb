        "## Theoretical Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. What is a RESTful API?\n",
        "A RESTful API is an architectural style for creating web services that use HTTP requests to access and manipulate data. It uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Explain the concept of API specification\n",
        "An API specification provides a blueprint for how the API works, including the endpoints, methods, request/response structure, authentication, and error handling. Examples include OpenAPI and RAML.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n",
        "Flask is a micro web framework for Python. It's popular due to its simplicity, flexibility, minimalism, and large ecosystem of extensions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. What is routing in Flask?\n",
        "Routing is the process of defining URLs and associating them with specific functions in your Flask application.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. How do you create a simple Flask application?\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from flask import Flask\n",
        "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
        "\n",
        "@app.route('/')\n",
        "def home():\n",
        "    return 'Hello World'\n",
        "\n",
        "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
        "    app.run(debug=True)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs?\n",
        "- GET: Read data\n",
        "- POST: Create data\n",
        "- PUT: Update data\n",
        "- DELETE: Delete data\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask?\n",
        "It binds a URL to a function, allowing that function to be triggered when the URL is accessed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8. What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?\n",
        "- GET: Sends data in URL, used for fetching data.\n",
        "- POST: Sends data in body, used for creating data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 9. How do you handle errors in Flask APIs?\n",
        "Using error handlers:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "@app.errorhandler(404)\n",
        "def not_found(error):\n",
        "    return 'Page not found', 404\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 10. How do you connect Flask to a SQL database?\n",
        "Using SQLAlchemy or Flask-SQLAlchemy extension:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy\n",
        "app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///data.db'\n",
        "db = SQLAlchemy(app)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 11. What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy?\n",
        "It simplifies database interactions by integrating SQLAlchemy with Flask.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 12. What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful?\n",
        "Blueprints help organize code into modular components, especially for larger apps.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 13. What is the purpose of Flask's request object?\n",
        "It allows access to request data such as form inputs, JSON, headers, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 14. How do you create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask?\n",
        "```python\n",
        "from flask import request\n",
        "@app.route('/api/data', methods=['POST'])\n",
        "def get_data():\n",
        "    data = request.json\n",
        "    return jsonify(data)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 15. What is the purpose of Flask's jsonify() function?\n",
        "It converts Python dictionaries into JSON responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 16. Explain Flask’s url_for() function\n",
        "It dynamically generates URLs for a given function name.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 17. How does Flask handle static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.)?\n",
        "Place files in the `/static` folder. Access via `/static/filename`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 18. What is an API specification, and how does it help in building a Flask API?\n",
        "It acts as a contract between client and server, ensuring consistency and documentation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 19. What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API?\n",
        "They indicate the result of an HTTP request (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 20. How do you handle POST requests in Flask?\n",
        "Using `request.form` or `request.json` inside a route with `methods=['POST']`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 21. How would you secure a Flask API?\n",
        "- Use HTTPS\n",
        "- Implement authentication (token-based, OAuth)\n",
        "- Input validation\n",
        "\n",
        "### 22. What is the significance of the Flask-RESTful extension?\n",
        "It simplifies building RESTful APIs by adding resources and request parsing.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 23. What is the role of Flask’s session object?\n",
        "It allows storing user-specific data across requests (like login sessions)."
