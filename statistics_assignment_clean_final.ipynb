    "## Question 1\n",
    "**What is the difference between descriptive statistics and inferential statistics? Explain with examples.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Short definitions\n",
    "- **Descriptive statistics:** methods for summarizing and describing the features of a dataset you have in hand. Typical summaries: mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, frequency tables, histograms, boxplots.\n",
    "- **Inferential statistics:** methods that use a sample of data to make estimates, predictions, or decisions about a larger population. They explicitly account for uncertainty (e.g., using confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, p-values).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key differences (pointwise)\n",
    "1. **Goal:** Descriptive = *summarize data*; Inferential = *generalize to population / test hypotheses*.\n",
    "2. **Data used:** Descriptive uses the full dataset or sample; Inferential treats the sample as a subset and uses probability to infer properties of the population.\n",
    "3. **Measures vs. Uncertainty:** Descriptive reports statistics; Inferential reports estimates **with** uncertainty (e.g., CI) and p-values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples (exam-style)\n",
    "- *Descriptive:* \"The average score of 50 students in the class is **74.2** with a standard deviation of **6.1**.\" This simply summarizes the observed class.\n",
    "- *Inferential:* \"From a random sample of 200 voters, 52% support candidate A. The 95% confidence interval is (45%, 59%) — therefore we estimate the population support lies in this range with 95% confidence.\" This uses the sample to infer about the whole population.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Short tip to score marks\n",
    "- Always state the **goal**, give **one numeric example** for each, and mention **uncertainty** when describing inferential methods.\n",

    "## Question 2\n",
    "**What is sampling in statistics? Explain the differences between random and stratified sampling.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling (definition)\n",
    "Sampling is selecting a subset (sample) from a larger population to observe and measure, with the aim of learning about the population while saving time or resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random sampling (simple random sample)\n",
    "- **Definition:** every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.\n",
    "- **Advantages:** unbiased selection (if done correctly), simple to analyze.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages:** may underrepresent small subgroups by chance.\n",
    "- **Example:** choose 100 students by randomly selecting student IDs from the full class list using a random number generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stratified sampling\n",
    "- **Definition:** divide the population into homogenous subgroups (strata) based on an important characteristic (e.g., age, gender), then take random samples from each stratum (often proportional to stratum size).\n",
    "- **Advantages:** ensures representation of key subgroups and can reduce sampling variance.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages:** requires knowledge of strata and can be more complex to implement.\n",
    "- **Example:** to survey 1,000 people in a city where 30% are aged 18–29, 40% are 30–49 and 30% are 50+, draw samples from each age group proportional to these percentages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use which\n",
    "- Use **random sampling** when the population is relatively homogeneous or when simplicity is critical.\n",
    "- Use **stratified sampling** when there are known subgroups that should be represented (to improve accuracy and fairness).\n",

    "**Define mean, median, and mode. Explain why these measures of central tendency are important.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definitions\n",
    "- **Mean (arithmetic mean):** \\(\\bar{x} = \\dfrac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\). The sum of all values divided by count.\n",
    "- **Median:** the middle value after sorting the data. If n is even, median is the average of the two middle values.\n",
    "- **Mode:** the value(s) that appear most frequently in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use which (exam-worthy bullets)\n",
    "- **Mean** — best for symmetric distributions and when you want the mathematical average; sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "- **Median** — robust to outliers and skewed data; preferred for income, property prices, or highly skewed distributions.\n",
    "- **Mode** — useful for categorical data or to identify the most common value(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Short example\n",
    "Given data: [2, 3, 3, 4, 100]\n",
    "- Mean ≈ 22.4 (pulled up by outlier 100)\n",

    "**Explain skewness and kurtosis. What does a positive skew imply about the data?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Skewness\n",
    "- **Definition:** measure of asymmetry of a probability distribution.\n",
    "  - **Positive skew (right skew):** tail extends to the right; mean > median. Common in income, house price distributions.\n",
    "  - **Negative skew (left skew):** tail extends to the left; mean < median.\n",
    "- **Interpretation tip:** look at histogram and compare mean vs median.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kurtosis\n",
    "- **Definition:** measure of \"tailedness\" (how heavy the tails are compared to a normal distribution).\n",
    "  - **High kurtosis (leptokurtic):** heavy tails and a sharp peak — more extreme outliers than normal.\n",
    "  - **Low kurtosis (platykurtic):** light tails and flatter peak.\n",
    "- **Note:** many software packages report *excess kurtosis* (kurtosis minus 3) so that a normal distribution has excess kurtosis 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What positive skew implies\n",
    "- Most observations are concentrated on the left (lower values) with a few large values on the right.\n",
    "- Mean is pulled to the right of the median.\n",
    "- Example practical implication: when data are positively skewed, report the median for a representative central value.\n",
