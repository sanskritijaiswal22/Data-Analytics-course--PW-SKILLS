        "\n",
        "**Answer (short):** Constraints enforce rules on table columns to maintain data integrity and consistency. They prevent invalid or inconsistent data from being stored.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Common constraints with examples:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- `PRIMARY KEY` — uniquely identifies each row (implies NOT NULL and UNIQUE).\n",
        "- `NOT NULL` — ensures a column always has a value.\n",
        "- `UNIQUE` — ensures column values are unique across rows.\n",
        "- `FOREIGN KEY` — enforces referential integrity between two tables.\n",
        "- `CHECK` — enforces a boolean expression (e.g., `age >= 18`).\n",
        "- `DEFAULT` — supplies a default value when none is provided.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why they help:**\n",
        "- Prevent duplicate or missing essential data (e.g., duplicate user emails).\n",
        "- Ensure relationships remain consistent (foreign keys prevent orphan records).\n",
