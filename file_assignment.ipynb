        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "- **Compiled languages** convert the whole program into machine code at once before running it. This makes execution faster but takes time to compile. Examples: C, C++\n",
        "-  **Interpreted languages** run the program line by line without converting the whole code into machine code at once. They are easier to debug but slower in execution. Examples: Python, JavaScript.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "- **Exception handling** in Python is a way to manage errors so that the program doesn’t crash. If something goes wrong during the program's execution, we can use try, except blocks to catch and handle the error. It helps in writing safe and user-friendly programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "- The finally block is used to write code that should always run, no matter whether an exception occurred or not. For example, closing a file or database connection. It ensures that important cleanup actions happen.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "- **Logging** means recording messages during the program's execution. Instead of using print() for debugging, we can use the logging module to track errors, warnings, and important events in a cleaner and more professional way.\n",

        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The **__del__ method** is a special method that is called when an object is about to be deleted. It is mainly used for cleanup activities like closing files or releasing memory when an object is no longer needed.\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "- Logging records what the program does, helping to find and fix errors easily. It provides different levels of messages (like info, warning, error) and can save logs to a file, unlike simple print statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Memory management means how Python assigns and frees memory for storing data during program execution. Python automatically handles this, making sure memory is used efficiently.\n",

        "- Optionally, use a finally block to run code regardless of errors (for cleanup).\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- It is important because poor memory use can slow down or crash programs. Good memory management keeps programs fast and stable.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The try block contains code that might cause errors. The except block catches those errors and stops the program from crashing, so it can continue running.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Python uses a garbage collector that tracks unused objects and frees their memory automatically. It mainly uses reference counting and also detects circular references to avoid memory leaks.\n",

        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Closing a file releases the resources used by the file and ensures that all data is properly saved. If files remain open, it can cause memory leaks or data corruption. Using with statement helps close files automatically.\n",

        "\n",
        "- file.read() reads the entire content of a file at once and returns it as a single string. It’s useful when you want to get everything from the file in one go.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "- The logging module in Python is used to record messages that show what a program is doing while running. It helps programmers track events, errors, or warnings in their code, making debugging and monitoring easier. Unlike print statements, logging can categorize messages by severity levels and save them to files.\n",

        "\n",
        "- The os module provides functions to interact with the operating system. In file handling, it helps to create, remove, rename, or check files and directories. For example, you can check if a file exists before opening it or delete a file you no longer need.\n",
